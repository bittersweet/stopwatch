# Stopwatch

Show the time that was necessary to render your page and the amount of queries that were executed.

## Installation

Just add the following to your __development__ group and you are good to go:

``` ruby
gem 'stopwatch'
```

Every page will now display the duration in the upper right corner and the
amount of (non-cached) queries.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by an article on the [Coding Horror
blog](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/performance-is-a-feature.html)
where they talk about how adding a small box that displays page speed motivated
them to not forget about the performance of their pages.

Some excerpts:

> The simple act of putting a render time in the upper right hand corner of
> every page we serve forced us to fix all our performance regressions and
> omissions.

> In fact, with the render time appearing on every page for everyone on the dev
> team, performance became a point of pride. We had so many places where we had
> just gotten a little sloppy or missed some tiny thing that slowed a page down
> inordinately.

I could especially identify with the last one and I wanted to quickly get this
gem out there to see if I could recreate that same effect.

## Caveats

* It removes etags so we can display it fresh every page load, otherwise the
response would get cached by the browser because Rails would return a 304 Not
Modified and you wouldn't see any changes on page refresh.

## Todo

* Basic configuration
