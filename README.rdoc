= Stopwatch

This is a simple gem to load a Rack middleware that works together with the
Rails 3 Notification API to display the page load time and amount of queries
executed

== Installation

just add the following to the development group in your Gemfile.

  gem 'stopwatch'

== Caveats

* It removes etags so we can display it fresh every page load, otherwise the response would get cached by the browser because Rails would return a 304 Not Modified.

== Todo

* Basic configuration
* Differentiate between cached and non-cached queries
